Project Summary
In this project, I learned how to interact with external APIs and handle asynchronous tasks using Promises and Promise chaining.
I explored how to fetch data from an API, dynamically update the UI based on the response, and manage different states like successful fetch and error handling.

Key Concepts Used

Call Stack (understanding JavaScript's execution flow)

HTML (structure)

CSS (styling)

JavaScript (core logic and asynchronous programming)
